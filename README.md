CLI tool to profile Terraform runs, written in Go.

Main features:
- Modern CLI ([cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra)-based) with autocomplete
- Read logs straight from your Terraform process (using pipe) or a log file
- Can generate global stats, resource-level stats or visualizations
- Provides many levels of granularity and aggregation and customizable outputs

## Installation

### Brew install
```bash
‚ù± brew tap datarootsio/tf-profile 
‚ù± brew install tf-profile
‚ù± tf-profile --help
tf-profile is a CLI tool to profile Terraform runs

Usage:
  tf-profile [command]
```

### Binary download

- Head over to the releases page ([https://github.com/QuintenBruynseraede/tf-profile/releases](https://github.com/QuintenBruynseraede/tf-profile/releases)) 
- Download the correct binary for your operating system
- Copy it to a path that is on your `$PATH`. On a Linux system, `/usr/local/bin` is the most common location.

### Using docker

If you want to try `tf-profile` without installing anything, you can run it using Docker (or similar).

```bash
‚ù± cat my_log_file.log | docker run -i qbruynseraede/tf-profile:0.5.0 stats

Key                                Value                                     
Number of resources created        1510                                      
                                                                             
Cumulative duration                36m19s                                    
Longest apply time                 7m18s                                     
Longest apply resource             time_sleep.foo[*]                         
...
```

Optionally, define an alias:

```bash
‚ù± alias tf-profile=docker run -i qbruynseraede/tf-profile:0.5.0
‚ù± cat my_log_file.log | tf-profile
```

### Build from source

This requires at least version 1.23 of the `go` cli.

```bash
‚ù± git clone git@github.com:QuintenBruynseraede/tf-profile.git
‚ù± cd tf-profile && go build .
‚ù± sudo ln -s $(pwd)/tf-profile /usr/local/bin  # Optional: only if you want to run tf-profile from other directories
‚ù± tf-profile --help
tf-profile is a CLI tool to profile Terraform runs

Usage:
  tf-profile [command]
```

## Basic usage

`tf-profile` handles input from stdin and from files. These two commands are therefore equivalent:

```bash
‚ù± terraform apply -auto-approve | tf-profile table
‚ù± terraform apply -auto-approve > log.txt && tf-profile table log.txt
```

Four major commands are supported:
- [üîó](#tf-profile-stats) `tf-profile stats`: provide general statistics about a Terraform run
- [üîó](#tf-profile-table) `tf-profile table`: provide detailed, resource-level statistics about a Terraform run
- [üîó](#tf-profile-filter) `tf-profile filter`: filter logs to include only certain resources
- [üîó](#tf-profile-graph) `tf-profile graph`: generate a visual overview of a Terraform run.


## `tf-profile stats`

`tf-profile stats` is the most basic command. Given a Terraform log, it will only provide high-level statistics.

```bash
‚ù± terraform apply -auto-approve > log.txt
‚ù± tf-profile stats log.txt

Key                                Value

```

For more information, refer to the [reference](./docs/stats.md) for the `stats` command.

## `tf-profile table`

`tf-profile table` will parse a log and provide per-resource metrics.

```bash
‚ù± terraform apply -auto-approve > log.txt
‚ù± tf-profile table log.txt

resource              n  tot_time  modify_started  modify_ended  desired_state  operation  final_state  
aws_ssm_parameter.p6  1  0s        6               7             Created        Replace    Created      
aws_ssm_parameter.p1  1  0s        7               5             Created        Replace    Created      
aws_ssm_parameter.p3  1  0s        5               6             Created        Replace    Created      
aws_ssm_parameter.p4  1  0s        /               1             NotCreated     Destroy    NotCreated   
aws_ssm_parameter.p5  1  0s        4               4             Created        Modify     Created      
aws_ssm_parameter.p2  1  0s        /               /             Created        None       Created      
```

For a full description of the options, see the [reference](./docs/table.md) page.

## `tf-profile filter`
`tf-profile filter` filters logs to include only certain resources. Wildcards are supported to filter on multiple resources.

```sh
‚ù± tf-profile filter "module.*.null_resource.*" log.txt

  # module.mod1.null_resource.foo will be created
  + resource "null_resource" "foo" {
    ...
    }

  # module.mod2.null_resource.bar will be created
  + resource "null_resource" "bar" {
    ...
    }

module.mod1.null_resource.foo: Creating...
module.mod2.null_resource.bar: Creating...
module.mod1.null_resource.foo: Creation complete after 1s [id=foo]
module.mod2.null_resource.bar: Creation complete after 1s [id=bar]
```

For a full description of the options, see the [reference](./docs/filter.md) page.



## `tf-profile graph`

`tf-profile graph` is used to visualize your terraform logs. It generates a [Gantt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gantt_chart)-like chart that shows in which order resources were created. `tf-profile` does not actually create the final image, but generates a script file that [Gnuplot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnuplot) understands. 

```bash
‚ù± tf-profile graph my_log.log --out graph.png --size 2000,1000 | gnuplot
```

![graph.png](https://github.com/QuintenBruynseraede/tf-profile/blob/main/.github/graph.png?raw=true)

_Disclaimer:_ Terraform's logs do not contain any absolute timestamps. We can only derive the order in which resources started and finished their modifications. Therefore, the output of `tf-profile graph` gives only a general indication of _how long_ something actually took. In other words: the X axis is meaningless, apart from the fact that it's monotonically increasing.
